# CSS 6: Links and images



## Introduction

- How to make links look a bit more interesting
- Dealing with images



## Link/anchors

Key properties you might like to change are:

```
a {}
a:hover {}
a:visited {}
a:active {}

```


## Images

Many of the basic box-model properties can also be applied to images. 

Try and see what the following do: 

- `width`
- `height`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `border`
