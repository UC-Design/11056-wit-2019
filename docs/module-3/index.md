## Additional Resources

One of the best things about learning to write HTML and CSS is that there is a huge amount of online resources, some include:

*   [CSS Tricks Almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/)
*   [Mozilla CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
*   [CSSreference.io](https://cssreference.io/)


## Don't forget 
*   **do NOT use the `<table>` tag to layout content**. It can only be used for tabular data (e.g. numbers).
*   We only want a single stylesheet for your own handwritten CSS.
*   Don't use any inline css
