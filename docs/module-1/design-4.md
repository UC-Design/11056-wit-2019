# Inspiration board 

For the first project, you need to compile an inspiration board which should include imagery of:

*   header, 
*   logo, 
*   navigation, 
*   footer, 
*   main content, 
*   typography (headings and body text) and 
*   key colours

!!! tip
    You'll notive that these align with the key web design attributes, they also align with the basic page elements you'll need to build in your website. 

## How to collect?

This really is up to you. Online, you might use [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com), [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) or some other kind of visual bookmarking tool. Have a search...

Or, you could take a screenshot and save to your computer - if you do this, record where the website came from! The main idea here is that you want to build up a few resources that you can refer back to when building your site. 

For example, if you get stuck trying to decide what the header should look like, you can then refer back to your board to get some inspiration.

## Submission

!!! information

You will need to record where each visual reference came from and include that alongside the imagery. How you present the information is up to you, but ultimately it will need to be submitted as a PDF.

You can use whatever tool you like: indesign, illustrator, word, pages, photoshop... you could export it straight from a webpage and save it as a PDF. The options are endless!
