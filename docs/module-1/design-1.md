# Design 1: Web Design Attributes

The first module will introduce you to key web design attributes and conventions. These will become more apparent as you start looking at, and thinking critically about, a wide range of different websites. One of the main aims of this module is to make you aware of the wide range of different styles that are used to define a website.

## Where to start?

As a new student, or even a student with existing knowledge of the field, it is super important to first understand the area in which you are working. By that I mean you should be familar with current Web design trends, conventions and common attributes. 

## Web Design research
Use these links to start your research process: 

*   [Site Inspire](https://www.siteinspire.com)
*   [Httpster](https://httpster.net/2018/jan/)
*   [Awwards](https://www.awwwards.com)

!!! tip
    There are heaps more, just try Googling 'web design inspiration'

## What to look for...

It is important to be able to critically assess and interpret digital works. As you start looking at different websites, you should think about the elements on them and ask yourself 'what do they consist of?'

For example:

*   Where is the header of the website? 
*   Does the website even have a header? 
*   What elements are within the header? 
*   Does it contain a logo and navigation items? 
*   Does it contain social media buttons? 
*   Does it stick to the top of the browser window as you scroll down? 
*   What colours does it use? 

and so on... 


## Understanding Web Conventions

As you start to look around at a wide range of website, you'll notice that they all share similar attributes. When the same attribute exists across a number of sites it could be considered as a design convention:

!!! info
    It is a convention to place the logo in the top left corner of the website. When you hover over the logo you expect to be able to click on it to return to the home page. 
    
## Common attributes

### Width
How wide is the website?

Most sites are responsive, have a fixed width, or are fluid. 

You can be responsive and still have a fixed width. 

We'll talk more about responsive design in [module 4](/../../module-4/).

### Alignment

How is the bulk of the page aligned?

Generally, it would be:

*   Centered 
*   Left aligned
*   Fluid (full width, no real alignment)

Rare to see a right aligned site

### Header
Includes

*   Logo
*   Navigation
*   Social media icons (sometimes)
*   Search
*   Hero content

Trend: to be fixed to top of screen on scroll - known as a sticky header

### Logo

Either an image or text

*   Try select it… if you can select the individual letters then it is text 
*   Good to change the logo on hover - provides the user with visual feedback, suggests they can click on it
*   Often links home

### Search

*   Generally only on larger sites with lots of content
*   Relies on a database or external system to work 

### Navigation
Three key types:

*   Primary
    *   What is most important

*   Secondary 
    *   Sub pages

*   Tertiary
    *   Third level, perhaps links in the footer

### Hero Content
Used to bring focus to something (e.g. a product for sale, or a blog post) 

Or to rotate through some images or video, bringing the website to life. 

### Sidebar
*   Does it exist?
*   They are going out of fashion…
*   Why? Because of responsive design

### Footer
*   Repeat the primary navigation
*   Social media icons
*   Copyright / Terms of Service / Credits

### Key colours

Most websites stick to a colour scheme

Lots of tools to help with choosing a colour scheme:

*   [HTML Colour Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
*   [Colour Lovers](https://www.colourlovers.com/)  
*   [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create)

### Key typefaces

How are they used together? 

Headings in sans-serif, content in serif or vice versa

See [Font Pair](https://fontpair.co/) for some good examples


### Special features

Look for

*   One-page website
*   Sticky header/footer
*   Fancy animation
*   Quirky features?
