# Website structure

As you'll start to realise, most websites are the same - even if they look different - they'll all share the same features.

When you come to start designing a website, you need to carefully think about the structure. Look at the resources you have and ask yourself the follwing questions: 

*   What content do you have? 
*   Who is the target audience?
*   Will it be image-heavy?
*   What kind of pages will you need?
*   Are there any required navigation items?

As you consider these questions, you should be able to start to form an idea of what the site should look like and how it will function. The structure will emerge from here.

Key things to think about when you start designing your site:

*   Content
*   Navigation
*   Basic layout



## Content

Are we talking lots of text or lots of images?

You need to know what the content is before you can really think about the structure of the website. The content will define the style of the site you are building and allow you to think about the navigation and the layout.



## Navigation
As you start looking at different websites you should keep an eye on the navigation. How many items do they have? How do they structure the navigation?

> Perhaps the most difficult part about navigation on the Web is organizing and designing it. ([Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/planning-and-implementing-website-navigation/))

There are 3 types of navigation:

**Primary**
Primary navigation is the content that users are most interested in. The main pages of the website.

**Secondary**
As you can imagine, this is the content that is of secondary interest. This could sub-pages (i.e. what you might see in a drop down menu).

**Tertiary**
The third level. This might include things like social media links, terms and conditions, privacy statements etc.  

Steve Krug wrote a very famous book called *Don't make me think*, make sure you read the key takeaways available [here](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/don-t-make-me-think-key-learning-points-for-ux-design-for-the-web).

## Layout

I really encourage you to start on paper.
