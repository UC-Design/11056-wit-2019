# The Design

(aka sketching and prototyping)

## Where should you start?

*   Use visual designs (pen/paper, Photoshop or similar) for quick layout exploration and asset creation
*   It’s impossible to accurately assess a web layout in .JPG form
*   a single Photoshop composition will only express a sliver of the layout potential a fully-flexible responsive site has...

!!! warning
    **Don't waste your time in Photoshop.** 

I'm a strong believer of using the _sketching in code_ methodology. This approach encourages rapid prototyping, directly with code. Read:

*   David Verba's [Sketching in Code: the Magic of Prototyping
](https://alistapart.com/article/sketchingincode) article from 2008 or 
*   Jared M. Spool's reflection [here](https://articles.uie.com/sketching_in_code/).



## Mockups/sketches & wireframes

*   What a .PSD file can’t easily show in terms of layout, you can communicate on a scrap of paper using a pencil
*   Wireframes can be as simple or as complex as you need them to be.

### Some ideas:
*   You might create an inspiration board with basic design attributes you can use to influence your design, 
*   or you might use photoshop to establish the “look & feel” of a digital design; 
*   you might use wireframes to map out the basic layout and functionality

!!! info
    **For the first project, you need to:** create Wireframes for 2 different page types: homepage and content page. These should be low-fidelity, use little content and be limited in colour.


## Tools
As you can imagine, there are a heap of tools you can use. It doesn't really matter what you use, as long as you can export your work! Here's a few which are good:

* [Moqups](https://moqups.com/pricing/sign-up?p=Ewy0d). Has a great free account you can use. 
* [Proto.io](https://proto.io/)
* [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) If you have access to the Adobe CC, then you might want to use this
* [Vectr](https://vectr.com/)
