## Front-end Frameworks

Many of you would already have heard of Bootstrap, even from my warning at the beginning of the unit - "don't use Bootstrap!"

Front-end frameworks are packages of pre-written code which are created to give you a base on which to build upon. They allow for rapid devlopment becuase you don't need to spend a huge amount of time creating your base elements, typography, navigation etc. 

As [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) says:

> Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.


A typical front-end framework would generally contain the following components:

*   A grid which makes it simple to organise the design elements of your website
*   Pre-defined typography settings - for headings, paragraphs, lists etc. 
*   Pre-built components like side panels, buttons, navigation, prompts etc



### Popular frameworks

Two of the most common front-end frameworks are:

*   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
*   [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)

And one I really like:

*   [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)

The problem with many frameworks is that developers/designers let the framework "carry" the design, rather than creating something unique. 

It is key to avoid counting on your framework to design your website. Donâ€™t let it determine your layout.

Go and have a look at various websites and you'll quickly realise what I mean. Check out [Every Bootstap Website Ever](https://www.dagusa.com/) to really understand. Also, read this article: [Why I shouldn't use a Web framework](https://dev.to/gypsydave5/why-you-shouldnt-use-a-web-framework-3g24)
