# Responsive 2: Getting started



## Where to start?

Before we move onto the code, let us consider a few extra important things. 



## The content 
**No amount of design or code can adequately fix content problems.**

Separate content and hierarchy from any single layout possibility, and work out what components & content your site needs.




### The importance of semantic HTML
Remember how we talked about the value of semantic markup in the second module?

Semantic markup is HTML that clearly defines the content `<article>` `<form>` `<table>` `<section>` `<figure>` `<video>`

Non-semantic mark-up tells us nothing about the content `<div>` `<span>`

Semantic markup is extremely portable, and ensures websites are ready to adapt to new contexts. 

!!! warning
    It is crucial that you use semantic markup when creating your websites. 



## How to test your site

Ok, so you'll need to test your code to see how it looks on different devices. This doesn't mean you need to go out and buy a few phones, a few different sized tablets, a laptop and a desktop computer - instead, you can emulate these different sized devices in your browser. 

From Chrome: just right click on the page and hit `inspect`, then enter [Device Mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/). 

In Safari: first go to the preferences (hit `cmd` + `,`), click advanced, then select `Show develop in menu bar`; then from the menu bar click `Develop` > `Enter responsive device mode`

In Firefox: follow [these instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode).

You should use the web inspector to see what elements you need to change at the various sizes. 

!!!tip
    Remember, any code you write in the web inspector won't actually be saved anywhere.
