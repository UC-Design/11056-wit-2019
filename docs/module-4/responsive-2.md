# Responsive 2: Getting started



## Where to start?

Before we move onto the code, let us consider a few extra important things. 



### The content 
**No amount of design or code can adequately fix content problems.**

Separate content and hierarchy from any single layout possibility, and work out what components & content your site needs.




#### The importance of semantic HTML
Remember how we talked about the value of semantic markup in the second module?

Semantic markup is HTML that clearly defines the content `<article>` `<form>` `<table>` `<section>` `<figure>` `<video>`

Non-semantic mark-up tells us nothing about the content `<div>` `<span>`

Semantic markup is extremely portable, and ensures websites are ready to adapt to new contexts. 

It is crucial that you use semantic markup when creating your websites. 




### The Design

Where should you start?

*   Use visual designs (pen/paper, Photoshop or similar) for quick layout exploration and asset creation
*   It’s impossible to accurately assess a responsive layout in .JPG form
*   a single Photoshop composition will only express a sliver of the layout potential a fully-flexible responsive site has...

!!! warning
    **Don't waste your time in Photoshop.** 

I'm a strong believer of using the _sketching in code_ methodology. This approach encourages rapid prototyping, directly with code. Read:

*   David Verba's [Sketching in Code: the Magic of Prototyping
](https://alistapart.com/article/sketchingincode) article from 2008 or 
*   Jared M. Spool's reflection [here](https://articles.uie.com/sketching_in_code/).




### Mockups & wireframes

*   What a .PSD file can’t easily show in terms of layout, you can communicate on a scrap of paper using a pencil
*   Wireframes can be as simple or as complex as you need them to be
*   Use Photoshop to establish the “look & feel” of a digital design; use wireframes to map out how they work, interact and respond to different conditions
*   There are thousands of tools out there; it doesn’t matter what you use.
