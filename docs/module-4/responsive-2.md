# Responsive 2: Getting started



## Where to start?

Before we move onto the code, let us consider a few extra important things. 



## The content 
**No amount of design or code can adequately fix content problems.**

Separate content and hierarchy from any single layout possibility, and work out what components & content your site needs.




### The importance of semantic HTML
Remember how we talked about the value of semantic markup in the second module?

Semantic markup is HTML that clearly defines the content `<article>` `<form>` `<table>` `<section>` `<figure>` `<video>`

Non-semantic mark-up tells us nothing about the content `<div>` `<span>`

Semantic markup is extremely portable, and ensures websites are ready to adapt to new contexts. 

!!! warning
    It is crucial that you use semantic markup when creating your websites.
