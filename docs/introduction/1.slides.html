                    ## Learning Outcomes
                    
                    By the end of this unit, we want you to be able to: 
                    
                    1. Identify and critique a range of front-end web design concepts, skills and theories;
                    2. Experiment with the creation of web-based interactive interfaces using appropriate concepts and techniques; and
                    3. Review and evaluate appropriate development methodologies in the creation of interactive works.




            
            
                
                    ## How we do it
                    
                    - You will learn how to write code (html and css)  
                    - Writing code is hard and time consuming - you need to stay on top of the work

                    - We hit the ground running!   
                    - We’ll cover a lot of content, especially in the first few weeks.



            

            
                
    ## Module approach
    
    There are 3 modules:
    - HTML and CSS
    - Responsive Web Design
    - Usability and Accessibility


            



            
                
                    ## Assessment items
                    
                    ### 3 assignments  
                    - Website Sketch: HTML. 15%. Due 5pm Friday, week 2
                    - Website Sketch: CSS. 25%. Due 5pm Friday, week 5
                    - Front-end Website Project. 60%. Due 5pm Friday, week 12


            
            
                
                    ## Website Sketch: HTML
                    
                    - Content from Module 1 
                    - Basic site (no styles) 
                    - Validate your code!


            

            
                
                    ## Website Sketch: CSS
                    
                    - Content from Module 1
                    - Build upon the work you've done in Module 1
                    - CSS and HTML

            

            
                
                    ## Front-end Website Project
                    
                    - Content from Modules 1, 2 and 3
                    - Build, test, refine
                    - We will work on the project in-class


            
            
                
                    ## Your responsibilities
                    
                    You need to check the unit outline and assessment information on Canvas to ensure you are following the brief and understand what is required of you…  


            
            
                
                    ## Extra Important!
                    
                    You must only submit your own code.  
                    That means:
                    - HTML5: do not use the <pre><code><table> </table></code></pre>tag to layout content
                    - No templates, libraries, pre-generated code, content management systems
                    - No Bootstrap, Wix, SquareSpace etc
                    - Pure css, no SASS


            
            
                
                    ## Plagiarism
                    
                    - Don’t copy other people’s code! 
                    - There is a difference between learning from and copying other people’s work
                    - That means don’t just refer to W3Schools (or an online resource) and take their examples
                    - You need to demonstrate your understanding with comments in the code
                    - If you are unsure, then ask us




            
            
                
                    ## Materials and Equipment
                    
                    **Code Editor**
                    - Many free options available. See links on Canvas.
                    
                    **GitHub**  
                    - Free, we'll use this to host your code 
                    - Can be a bit intimidating to get start with



            
            
                
                    ## Unit structure
                    
                    **Lectures**  
                    - This is the last F2F lecture
                    - Traditional lecture content will be delivered in the workshops
                    
                    **Workshops**  
                    - Not recorded
                    - We will work on parts of the assessment items in the workshops


            
            
                
                    ## Front-end Web 
                    
                    - What is it?
                    
                    **Core languages**  
                    - HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language
                    - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets


            

            
                
                    ## The End.
                    
                    **Questions?**
