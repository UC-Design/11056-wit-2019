## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, we want you to be able to: 

1. Identify and critique a range of front-end web design concepts, skills and theories;
2. Experiment with the creation of web-based interactive interfaces using appropriate concepts and techniques; and
3. Review and evaluate appropriate development methodologies in the creation of interactive works.







## How we do it

- You will learn how to write code (html and css)  
- Writing code is hard and time consuming - you need to stay on top of the work

- We hit the ground running!   
- We’ll cover a lot of content, especially in the first few weeks.







## Module approach

There are 4 modules:
- Designing for the Web 
-   HTML 
-   CSS
- Responsive CSS

## Your responsibilities

You need to check the unit outline and assessment information on Canvas to ensure you are following the brief and understand what is required of you…  





## Extra Important!

You must only submit your own code.  
That means:
- HTML5: do not use the <pre><code><table> </table></code></pre>tag to layout content
- No templates, libraries, pre-generated code, content management systems
- No Bootstrap, Wix, SquareSpace etc
- Pure css, no SASS





## Plagiarism

- Don’t copy other people’s code! 
- There is a difference between learning from and copying other people’s work
- That means don’t just refer to W3Schools (or an online resource) and take their examples
- You need to demonstrate your understanding with comments in the code
- If you are unsure, then ask us







## Materials and Equipment

**Code Editor**
- Many free options available. See links on Canvas.

**GitHub**  
- Free, we'll use this to host your code 
- Can be a bit intimidating to get start with
