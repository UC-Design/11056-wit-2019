## Introduction

## Semantic HTML

We will learn to write [Semantic HTML](https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271)

> Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined to have certain meanings (semantics). For example, the `ol` element represents an ordered list, and the `lang` attribute represents the language of the content. [(W3C, HTML 5.1 spec)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-html51-20161101/dom.html#elements-semantics)

Berners-Lee first discussed the concept in 2001.

Essentially they provide meaning to the content on a HTML page, rather than just focusing on presentation.

Before HTML5 the structure/layout of a page was built using the `<div>` tag


The `<div>` tag has no semantic value

HTML5 brought new elements for semantically defining structure:

```
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <aside>, <footer>
```

You must use some of these tags in your website. 




## Semantic HTML5 tags

Default HTML5 structure

Heading tags
`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`
