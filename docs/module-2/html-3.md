# Site Setup



## Introduction

- Setting up your workspace
- Getting file names right



## Workspace setup

- It is crucial to get the initial setup right
- Need to be aware of folder structure 
- Helpful if you already know the page structure


                
## Folder structure

    Errors in the folder structure and file names are the number 1 reason students fail the final assignment



## Folders

When you created your GitHub repo, you created the folder that will hold your site. 

You need to ensure that you:
- Save everything needed for the website inside that folder
- Do not move the files around - you will break the links if you do
- Put the assets (images, CSS file) in subfolders to help you organise
- All HTML files should be in the root folder

You need to use the required folder structure for your projects


## Required folder structure

Root directory is the top-level folder (the repo folder)
- I.e. the folder that contains any sub-folders
- All HTML files MUST be in the root directory

Inside the root directory, you will have an assets folder  
it will contain at least two extra folders:
- One for your CSS
- One for your images



## Case sensitive

The web is case sensitive

That means:

ALL folder and filenames must match
- `assets/Images` and `assets/images` are not the same

Keep **folder and filenames in lowercase** for simplicity



## File names

As before,   
Errors in the folder structure and file names are the number 1 reason students fail the final assignment

Get it right at the beginning



## File name rules

There are some rules on the web that you must follow

If you don’t, your website won’t work online

There are some exceptions, but for this project we have certain requirements, make sure you know what they are...



### Rule 1: lowercase

1. All filenames must be in lowercase
On the Web, `mypage.html` is different to `Mypage.html` 



### Rule 2: no spaces

2. There cannot be any spaces in filenames (or folders)
If the filename was `my page.html` and in the code you linked to the file as `mypage.html` it would not load



### Rule 3: default naming

3. The homepage must be called index.html
Regardless of what you want to call the first page of your website, the filename must be `index.html` 

Not: `homepage.html`, `default.html` or anything else 



## Rules again...

1. All filenames must be in lowercase
2. There cannot be any spaces in filenames (or folders)
3. The homepage must be called `index.html`



## File location

HTML files must be in the root folder

- CSS file to go in `assets/css`
- All images in `assets/images`

This might seem overly specific now, but small mistakes at this stage can cause huge issues later.
