# Submission

You need to push your code to GitHub and submit the link to the public GitHub repository on Canvas.

Your rationale can either be included as a markdown file within the GitHub repository or saved as a pdf and included in the site folder or uploaded to Canvas. 



## Public or private
If your repository is set to be private then we won't be able to access it and you will lose points. Here's how to check:

Double check by visiting the repository page on GitHub.com, (i.e. login to your account, click the repo name). If it says 'private' next to the title then you should be good to go. If it says `Private` then follow the steps below, or [in this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-repository-visibility):

To change it to public, do this:

1.  Go to the repository on GitHub.com (login)
1.  Click Settings
1.  Scroll down to the bottom to the 'Danger Zone' 
1.  The first item will say something about making it public (if it says something about going private then you are fine). 
1.  Click the button, follow the instructions and you will be good to go.

## GitHub Link

The link you need to submit is the one in the browser window, it might look something like this:

`https://github.com/UC-Design/11056-wit-2019`



## Reflection

### As a PDF
Simply save as a PDF from your word/text editor.

### As a markdown file
The better way!

Markdown is simple text formatting language used on the web, it allows a user to easily write files/text which can be converted to any format. All the pages on this site are written in markdown (`.md`) and converted to html for you to see. 

To submit your reflection as a markdown file, you just need to copy the text from your word/google docs file and paste it into a markdown file:

-   Open the `readme.md` file we created right at the beginning of the project. 
-   Copy the text from another location and paste it into the file. Or write it directly into the `md` file, but don't forget to do a spell check.
-   Format the text as needed, e.g. this means `# Heading 1`; `## Heading 2`; `### Heading 3` and so on. There's a great [Cheat Sheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
-   Save, push to GitHub and done!
