# Questions and Answers

## Project 2

### Q: I'm working on my project to build a  responsive website, just I have got a question how could I use single CSS file for multiple pages such as home page and sub pages? do I need to use multiple CSS files for multiple pages ?

A: You should only use one CSS file for all your pages (plus your reset).  You can create different CSS rules for the unique elements in each page, but if you have designed your site well you won't need to do this too often.  The main layout elements of your pages should be styled consistently, so you shouldn't need to modify the CSS for those.


### Q: Are we allowed to crop the image in the source-content and use it ? 

A: Yep, definitely. But remember, you aren't being marked on the images or content, so focus on the code itself. 


### Q: For the reflection, I don't quite understand the meaning of “ include associated imagery and reference. What should be mainly covered in rationale? 

A: The rationale lets you explain to us how you have worked on the assignment and why you made any design decisions.  So associated imagery might include screenshots of sites or site components that inspired your design, a colour palette that you put together, or some of the fonts that you tried.  References would include articles that you read, sites that you visited to solve problems or learn techniques, and other material (outside of the course material) that helped you complete the assignment.


### Q: Can we use javascript / jQuery?

A: Ideally not. We don’t expect you to know javascript when completing the unit. There are many things you can do with CSS, without having to resort to using javascript.  

We aren’t assessing you on your use or understanding of javascript but we are assessing you on the use of semantic html and understanding of CSS. Take it as a challenge, how can I do this with pure CSS?!

If you have any questions about the use of javascript, shoot your tutor an email.
